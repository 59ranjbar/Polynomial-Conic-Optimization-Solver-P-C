# Polynomial-Conic-Optimization-Solver-P-C
This solver solves univariate polynomial conic optimizaiton via its dual, this is moment conic optimization in Chebyshev basis. The solver uses a type of non-symmetric homogeneous self-dual predictor-corrector interior point method to solve the moment conic optimization.
