# Polynomial-Conic-Optimization-Solver-P-C
This solver solves univariate polynomial conic optimizaiton in the Chebyshev basis via its dual, i.e. moment conic optimization in the Chebyshev basis. The solver uses a type of non-symmetric homogeneous self-dual predictor-corrector interior point method to solve the moment conic optimization.

The solver needs drsolve package to be in the path. "drsolve" is a matlab package that solves Hankel/Toeplitz or Hankel+Toeplitz systems in a stable and fast way.
